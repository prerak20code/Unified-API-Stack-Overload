ðŸ§© Problem Statement
DIC hosts numerous innovative student-driven and research-based projects, but their core functionalities remain inaccessible to the broader student and developer community. Most projects are built in silos, lacking standardized APIs for reuse, collaboration, or integration. This creates barriers for potential adopters, contributors, or developers looking to build on existing work. This project aims to unify and expose these functionalities through public-facing, secure, and scalable REST APIs, enabling easy consumption, reusability, and greater impact of DIC projects.

Week 1:
For the week 1 we have studied different models on which API's can be built we found 2 models who already have API's and learned about them tested the API's.
Before running any api we have to check and verify that the specific models has been installed in our machine or not and to do that we have to first read the instructions carefully
1.Licenseplatedetector- This runs on Open CV cv2 model and to run the code for it we have to run the following command:
!pip install open-image-models[onnx]


2.Whisperapi-This takes a audio file and gives its transcription to run this api we have to run the following commands;
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
pip install torch
pip install torchvision
